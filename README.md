# Ansible_management_node
Management node for ansible - dockerized. Created to manage VPS with ipv6 address only.

Caution: In my case I am using Windows 11 with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and creating docker instance inside WSL to server as ansible management node.

Linux directory for mounting (im my case)
```
cd /mnt/c/users/tgusc/documents/github/ansible_management_node
```
Useful docker commands:
1. Re-build detached image (if any underlying files changed)
```
docker-compose up -d --build
```

2. Build and start the container (detached). You have to be in directory with docker files
```
docker-compose up -d
```

3. Access the container
```
docker-compose exec ansible bash
```

4. Stop the container after you are done
```
docker-compose down
```

5. View logs
```
docker-compose logs
```

6. Check containers names and status
```
docker ps
```

7. Copy files from local to container
```
docker cp .\path\to\local\file ansible:/path/in/container/
```

8. Copy files from container to local
```
docker cp ansible_management_node-ansible-1:/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg .\ansible_config\ansible.cfg
```

9. Running with full logs
```
docker-compose up --build && docker-compose logs -f ansible
```

Powershell Version : 
```
docker-compose up --build; if ($?) { Write-Host "Build successful, following logs:" -ForegroundColor Green; docker-compose logs -f ansible } else { Write-Host "Build failed" -ForegroundColor Red }
# close with ctrl+ c
```

10. test ssh connection with VPS
```
ssh user@hostname/ip
ping ip
traceroute6 ip
```

11. Check your docker connectivity settings
```
docker network inspect bridge
```

12. Clean networks and containers
```
docker-compose down
docker network prune
```
inside docker:
```
# look for inet6 entries 
ip -6 neigh show
ip -6 neigh show
```

## WSL config on WSL - in order to be able to properly connect to ipv6 VPS from WSL container

WSL SSH connection Check
1. Need to establish permissions and settings
https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/automatically-configuring-wsl/  
https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/systemd-support-is-now-available-in-wsl/
```
sudo vim /etc/wsl.conf
```

Contents should look like:
```
[boot]
systemd=true

[automount]
options = "metadata"
```

Or alternatively create file by code without vim
```
sudo tee /etc/wsl.conf > /dev/null <<EOT
[boot]
systemd=true
[automount]
options = "metadata"
EOT
```

## WSL config on Windows - /users/user/.wslconfig file

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/networking#mirrored-mode-networking
.wslconfig file suggested content:
```
[wsl2]
networkingMode=mirrored
```

## WSL setup on WSL - install ssh on WSL + change permissions on SSH keys to maintain security requirements
Do in WSL environment (paths and ssh keys names will be probably different)
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server
eval $(ssh-agent -s)
chmod 700 /mnt/c/users/tgusc/.ssh
chmod 600 /mnt/c/users/tgusc/.ssh/id_ed25519
chmod 644 /mnt/c/users/tgusc/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
chmod 600 /mnt/c/users/tgusc/.ssh/mikrus
chmod 644 /mnt/c/users/tgusc/.ssh/mikrus.pub
cd /mnt/c/users/tgusc/.ssh
ls -la /mnt/c/users/tgusc/.ssh
# add ssh-keys to agent
ssh-add /mnt/c/users/tgusc/.ssh/id_ed25519
ssh-add /mnt/c/users/tgusc/.ssh/mikrus
ssh-add -l

# Connecting with SSH via agent
ssh -A -p user@hostname/ip (dziaÅ‚a)
```

## Possible issues
1) If you can't see letters in your CLI no more (because you copied commands from windows to WLS Unix for example) use below command:
```
reset
```


## Ansible commands

1. Check connectivity to hosts
```
ansible all -m ping
```

2. In playbook folder - execute playbook site.yaml
```
ansible-playbook site.yaml
```
